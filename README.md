Remove the apparatus and verse numbers from SGLGNT pdfs

While the SBLGNT contains my favorite apparatus of any critical edition of the New Testament, it is pleasant to read scripture without all of the critical mark accretions.

To use, copy and past one of the SBLGNT pdf texts into a text file. Run the following:

```
cat mark.txt | ./convert.py > mark_without_marks.txt
```
